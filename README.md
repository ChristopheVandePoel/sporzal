# sporzal

A small portal to use locally so you can circumvent the sporza website. I created it because the site kept crashing my video.

If you run this locally, use: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en

Dependencies: nodeJs

locally, run: 

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

Go to localhost:3000
